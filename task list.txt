bool
	becomes true when code block is executed for the first time (ontop of something)
	have itso that the codew block has another condition, if true dont run
	once you move off, set bool back to false 

	bool, when touch tile and execute code, keep value as true and only set to false when you're on grass

	look into using a getter to find if the players value is changing or not, if changing then it is a problem with the sprite, if not changing then its a problem with the setter
