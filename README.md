# Farming Simulator Game

## Project Description
This was my FIRST coding project at university and was critical in helping me learn the fundamentals of object oriented programming as well as much, much more. Not only was I able to learn about concepts like project planning, utilising UML diagrams and figuring out Git basics, I enjoyed the aspect of working together with my team member to create this project. Although currently incomplete and quite buggy, this project overall has methods for SFML implementation, and basic gameplay features such as planting crops, buying seeds and character movement.  

## Challenges Faced and Features for the Future
Ideally I'd like to round out some of the bugs and errors in this project and revamp it to give players a smoother experience and one that hopefully won't be filled with so many segmentation errors! My main challenge for this project was reading documentation for SFML and trying to wrap my head around the basics of using the library while having only just learnt object oriented design. Looking back it should've been quite similar to the principles I had learnt throughout my course however this is definitely something I took a little longer to grasp.

## Running the Project
If you're brave enough to sample it:
1. Simply download the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Farming-Game.git

2. and just try run the project again and again until theres no segmentation faults and you can actually move around ! :D
