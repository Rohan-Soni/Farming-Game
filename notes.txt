Sprites and Textures
    Create a texture (i.e., sf::Texture "texture variable name whatever you choose it to be")
        Make sure you provide have the right file path
    Create the sprite    
        Set texture to sprite
        Set size
    Sprites and textures must be drawn within while window loop
        Wipe the window, draw sprite, display window

**Difference between a sprite and a texture::
    A texture is an image but has the specific role of being mapped to a 2D entity.
    A sprite is nothing more than a textured rectangle. 

Game Tiles
    To setup game tiles, a header folder and a cpp file is made.
    Header File:
        Game tiles include the position, the textures, the sprites, the tile constructor itself,
            and a boolean to setup the sprite (attach a texture to the sprite).
    Cpp File:
        Initialise constructor with all attributes
        Set position


Game World
    Basically initalising the definitions for all the tiles really

Game Map
    Build the map as a 2D list of game tiles
